# Ebig-shaders
Shaders that are ebig

If you want to create an edit of this project you may, so long as you credit me in wherever you post it.

You may not copy my code and reproduce it as your own. You may however, edit my code and send it to friends. This isn't a paid shader so if you send it to your friend to make things easier that's fine. However you may not mass reproduce it.

I am new to coding shaders, so I've looked into shaders like Sildur's enhanced default, Molly
